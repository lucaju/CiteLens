I have also created taxonomy in TEI header, with ref targets in the text pointing to the XML ID of the semantic categories. I have also modified the bibliographic structure (note tag has replaced all parenthetical citations). I have embeded chapter titles and author information in the header. I have cleaned up the persName, placeName, and orgName tags, so that they do not include punctuation. I have added a subtype attribute to all persNames placeNames, in order to regularize names. I have also cleaned up the note tags, ensuring that there are no spaces between the notes and sentence level punctuation.-->

                <p xml:id="P07">The digital turn is transforming research so thoroughly it is
                    remaking our institutions. Research libraries have a long established tradition
                    of collecting and preserving scholarly works, albeit in the analog formats in
                    which they were created. As research and scholarship evolve, so must the roles
                    and practices of libraries in this new digital era. The <orgName

                <p xml:id="P1">Over the last century, folk songs and stories, obituaries, paintings,
                    newspaper advertisements, and local histories have depicted Island women as
                    mystical mermaids, biblically incited victims of their body, and sometimes as
                    gracious and gentle women. But in their own words in their journals women write
                    themselves through their daily rituals of managing households, planting their
                    gardens or stretching the parameters of home; they contextualize themselves
                    within what <persName subtype="Kathryn_Carter">Kathryn Carter</persName> refers
                    to as <soCalled>&apos;the small details&apos;</soCalled> of their everyday and
                    through deflated expressions like &quot;dull day.&quot;</p>

                <p xml:id="P2">In this paper I intend to examine the images of women popularly
                    available and juxtapose those images with the representations women generate in
                    their life writing. Journals, diaries, and letters by women from the nineteenth
                    and early twentieth century are not widely available; my research on twenty such
                    Island women is based on their unpublished manuscripts obtained from the
                        <orgName type="bureaucratic_institution"

                            type="acronym">PAROPEI</abbr></orgName>). Redeeming women from their
                    place of obscurity in their diaries and locating their inscribed sites of
                    representation have indeed opened up a new chapter in women&apos;s writing.
                    Inspired by <persName subtype="Sheila_Rowbotham">Sheila
                    Rowbotham</persName>&apos;s work on women <quote>&quot;hidden from
                        history,&quot;</quote> I began to expand my collection of Island
                    women&apos;s unpublished life writing and develop strategies for reading and
                    understanding these <soCalled>&quot;messy&quot;</soCalled>
                            documents.<note><bibl>Weiland 204</bibl></note>
                    <ref target="#formal_response">Multiple readings of these diaries, ledgers,
                        account books, and scraps of paper convinced me that the women&apos;s choice
                        of the autobiographical genre was instrumental in their textual articulation
                        of voice. The diary could accept entries at any time, on any subject and
                        allow for textual resolutions unheard of elsewhere. Initially for the
                        reader/researcher of these original handwritten texts the task of
                        understanding the sporadic and varied handwriting and idiosyncratic textual
                        resolutions of each diarist such as gaps, vagueness or silence about the
                            <soCalled>&quot;unsayable&quot;</soCalled> seemed insurmountable. But as
                            <persName subtype="Rebecca_Hogan">Rebecca Hogan</persName> has
                        indicated, such practices are typical of <foreign xml:lang="fr"
                            rend="italic">l&apos;ecriture feminine </foreign> where the parataxical
                        fragments of ungrammatical passages reflect the
                            <quote>&quot;non-hierarchical flow of events&quot;</quote> that make up
                        a woman&apos;s life.<note><bibl>Hogan 4</bibl></note> The sought-after
                        cohesion in life writing texts comes through multiple readings of the
                        diaries and lining up these documents with other cultural artifacts such as
                        histories, paintings or even anecdotal evidence.</ref></p>

                <p xml:id="P3">Typically these ordinary women in their diaries refrained from
                    confronting and confessing immediate threats and instead the diarist creates a
                    lacunae or silence on the subject which the diary reader often in retrospect
                    fills in. In the case of the five-year diary of my grandmother <persName
                        subtype="Amy_Andrew">Amy Andrew</persName>
                    <date from="1881" to="1966">(1881-1966)</date>, anecdotal evidence on an
                    incident recorded and often spoken about indicated that she downplayed the
                    accident and wrote of a <quote>&quot;fright&quot;</quote> (1912) while the scar
                    on her arm spoke of a more serious accident. On other occasions she created gaps
                    in her diary, unable to find the language for the
                        <soCalled>&quot;unsayable&quot;</soCalled> situation of being newly married.

                        <soCalled>&quot;account book&quot;</soCalled> that she too had been

                <p xml:id="P4">Numerous women diarists diverted their diary entries away from
                    personal dilemmas and instead concentrated on the birth and death of farm
                    animals rather than the same fates of their nearest and dearest. <persName

                    attending church; similarly, when the mare died, she wrote again:
                        <quote>&quot;did not go to church.&quot;</quote> She could not admit to her
                    sorrow but by her actions she could acknowledge an inability to fall into the

                <p xml:id="P5">Island women&apos;s diaries have emerged like sandstones surfacing
                    with the outgoing tide. With each receding wave more sandstones appear as the

                    Through time and systematically sifting in archives these diary gems emerged.

                    early-twentieth-century artifacts. Newspaper archives, anthologies of folk songs
                    and stories prove to be a rich site for finding women&apos;s visual

                        the role of religion, and how representative these diaries of Island women

                        part of the cultural baggage immigrants brought to their new

                <p xml:id="P33">The literacy that Bible reading facilitates appears to go hand in
                    hand with diary keeping. Women diarists such as <persName

                    instead to follow the reading and interpretation of scripture by their clergy.
                    There is little evidence that Island women rigorously examined themselves and
                    the lives they were leading or how they had fallen away from God, as <persName

                    and imperfections which emerged in their everydayness.</p>

                    the document with pride and seek to have it immortalized, making the artifact
                    publicly available in the archives? It appears that <orgName type="religion"
                        subtype="Catholic">Catholic</orgName> women did not participate in the

                <p xml:id="P44"> Midi Onodera&apos;s film <title rend="italic">The Displaced
                        View</title> (1988) deftly addresses issues of language and identity
                    confronting Japanese Canadians at the time of its release in the late nineteen
                    eighties. The film is predominantly a narrative reconstruction of the lost
                    history of the director&apos;s Japanese Canadian family: a history that includes
                        <emph rend="italic">evacuation</emph><note>In the section entitled
                        Historical Background, I have explained the meaning of this term at length.
                        However, in short, I am following Roy Miki&apos;s lead in using this
                        recuperated term (first employed by the Canadian government), to indicate
                        the history of what is often referred to as the Japanese Canadian
                        &quot;internment.&quot; &quot;Internment,&quot; however, does not encompass
                        the complexity of wartime events associated with government imposed
                        displacement, internment, relocation, dispossession,
                        deportation/repatriation etc., that occurred between Pearl Harbour and 1949,
                        when Japanese Canadians were again allowed to return to the West
                        Coast.</note> away from the West Coast during the Second World War. </p>
                <p xml:id="P45"> The film negotiates itself between several layers of meaning: that
                    which is known, that which has been imagined, and that which cannot be added to
                    the re-membering <note>The hyphen in &quot;re-member&quot; indicates that this
                        is not only a project of memory but also one of reconfiguring the membership
                        of Japanese Canadian communities.</note> either because it has been
                    permanently forgotten or because it was never understood or known. <ref
                        target="#narrative_technique">Functioning as a community autobiography, the
                        film records the unveiling of wartime events to a younger generation through
                        a dialogue with history and with older family members. The dynamics of the
                        image re-represent the space of oblivion: that which has been permanently
                        erased from the cultural community memory. Confronted with the obliviation
                        of history, Onodera&apos;s narrative proposes that the missing
                        history/stories must be imagined into a new vision (revision) of identity:
                        personal, familial and communal.</ref>
                </p>
                <p xml:id="P46"> One cause of the obliviation of history, in this case, was the
                    reactionary choice of many Japanese Canadians to stop speaking Japanese in the
                    post-war era. This was an effort to integrate and to demonstrate loyalty to the
                    Canadian nation. By adopting English and extinguishing the use of Japanese as a
                    family and community language, the transmission of language to the younger
                    generations came to an abrupt halt. This simultaneously created a caesura with
                    heritage culture and it silenced the <emph rend="italic">issei</emph> (first
                    generation Japanese Canadian).<note>The terms, &quot;issei&quot;,
                        &quot;nisei&quot;, and &quot;sansei&quot; appear repeatedly in this article.

                    parents and grandparents. The silencing of individual, family and communal

                        itself in 1971, multiculturalism was a lived and practiced reality. With the
                        official declaration of multiculturalism, it became even more complex as a
                        rubric, since lived reality was not necessarily integrated into the official
                        bilingual Canadian vision of a multicultural nation. State multiculturalism
                        was based on the pride of one&apos;s heritage and the acceptance of
                        specified representations such as the culinary and the performative aspects
                        of heritage cultures. In the end, the term multiculturalism is a contested
                        one, since, throughout the decades, attempts by certain individuals and/or
                        ethno-cultural groups have been made to go beyond the limits imposed by
                        state multiculturalism in order to enter into a dialectic with political
                        power structures, so as to acquire participatory visibility beyond the
                        integrated spaces of performance. This process was undermined by the Meech
                        Lake Accord, which impeded the aspirations of ethno-cultural groups wanting
                        to contribute to a sense of what defines Canadian identity. In other words,
                        identity as a process of negotiation was once again limited by the
                        definition of a bilingual country so that multiculturalism becomes a form of
                        entertainment.</quote>

                    better understanding herself, her matrilineal parentage and the meaning of being
                    Japanese Canadian. Onodera, as sansei narrator, asks the following questions:
                        <quote>&quot;Am I a Japanese Canadian, or a person &apos;of Japanese
                        descent&apos;? Passing as. In the closet when. I am guilty of playing it

                            Japanese Descent: An Interim Report</title> – used to explain Japanese
                        Canadian internment to the Canadian population. Onodera is likely aware of
                        both the term and the film as she makes this comment.</note> Admitting that
                    it is easier to deny her heritage than confront it, she exists in a liminal
                    space, floating between signifiers, in order to adapt to the demands of state
                    multiculturalism. </p>

                    <ref target="#narrative_technique">Onodera has constructed the narrative of
                            <title rend="italic">The Displaced View</title> to juxtapose the
                        perspectives of the these three women – daughter, mother, grandmother – and
                        to instate differing generational, cultural and linguistic perspectives. The
                        narrative does not seek to record the family history for posterity, but
                        rather to create one in absentia. Where there has been no story, Onodera has
                        fantasized a matriarchal figure, creating a genealogical history. Framed by
                        tangible wishes and fairytales, the absence of a spoken history creates the
                        space for an imagined family story.<note>This happens in other later films,
                            such as Kerri Sakamoto and Rea Tajiri&apos;s <title rend="italic">The
                                Strawberry Fields </title>(1997). Luke, who was adopted, parodies
                            his past; through this character the film criticizes the mass media for
                            defining ethnic identities. He is cut off from history and his sense of
                            place. Luke, Irene&apos;s boyfriend, does not want to find his real
                            parents. Instead, he prefers the fantasy that he has created of his
                            parents by relying on media images and stereotypes. His girlfriend,
                            Irene, criticizes him for his inability to face his own past:
                                <quote>&quot;You can&apos;t face the truth. You cut out pictures

                            Ohama, the messages of the great-granddaughter resonate with those of
                            Midi Onodera. The yonsei great-grandchild imagines that the family has
                            descended from the imperial palace, and that she might find out that she
                            is a princess, once Obāchan&apos;s secrets are revealed. </note> In the
                        absence of any knowledge of her grandparents&apos; past, the narrator as a
                        young child fantasized that her grandmother and grandfather were the old man
                        and his wife in <title rend="italic">The Crane Wife</title>fairytale.</ref>
                    Onodera uses this fairy-tale as a framing device and imagines her grandmother to

                    what she wanted to know had been there for the questioning. The answers were

                        history. However, the issei also experienced the crucial liminal moment of
                        immigration. In some cases, they lived through all three of these events,
                        experiencing multiple displacements: immigration, <emph rend="italic"

                    on a literal exploration of the BC interior, trying to locate the sites of

                    reflection: the deconstruction and reinvention of history and identity. When
                    Onodera goes in search of the old internment camps scattered across BC, they are
                    not marked by the maps – spatial oblivion – and she does not know what she will

                    Japanese Canadian community in general throughout the 1940s. In many cases,
                    nothing identifiable denotes the locations of the internment camps since nature
                    has reclaimed these sites; the mainstream nation bears no scars. Nature&apos;s
                    reclamation of these physical spaces parallels the &quot;naturalization&quot; of
                    the de facto obliviation of Japanese Canadian communities caused by government
                    policies during and after the war. In this sense <placeName><country
                            subtype="Canada">Canada</country></placeName>, with its mythopoiesis of
                    the natural landscape, is able to re-absorb any societal glitch that has
                    occurred, much like a Pilate&apos;s washing of hands in the stream of history.
                    Japanese Canadians, however, need no a physical marker of the trauma of
                    evacuation for it to continues to exist as a wound in their psyche and lived
                    reality. <ref target="#intertextuality">Onodera&apos;s voyage to Sandon, Slocan
                        City and New Denver unfurls the concept of the internment camp as a mythical
                        place/space, erased from the landscape, just as family histories had been
                        erased for several decades between the war&apos;s end and the redress
                        period. This resonates with the tropes of silence and the discovery of

                        novel, acknowledges its status as a text, a narrative construct, a fallible
                        medium through which one potential (never absolute) version of history and
                        one interpretation of truth can be reconstructed.</ref> This experimental
                    film follows Onodera&apos;s journey back to an identity that requires partial
                    reinvention. Through this process, the sansei narrator is replacing her
                    childhood fantasies about her grandmother&apos;s biography with her
                    grandmother&apos;s own telling of events. Still, the new version cannot be
                    replaced by a tangible version, verifiable by places and facts. It too relies on
                    the grandmother&apos;s failing memories and interpretations of her own history. </p>

                <p xml:id="P63"> The grandmother&apos;s lived experience is potentially less
                    impressive than the fairytale the narrator has told herself for her entire life,
                    but by replacing the fairytale with the bits of information that she gleans
                    about her grandmother&apos;s past, the narrator is able to create a new, more
                    nuanced, (her)story. Between the various generational views of the grandmother,
                    mother and daughter, supplemented by family pictures and historical documents,
                    exists a story of the evacuation: floating in the liminal space between the
                    images that remain, the places that remain, the people that remain and their
                    varying points of view on what happened during and after the war. Some facts
                    have been lost or are too difficult to recall. However, it is not the facts of
                    the evacuation that are solely important to the creation of a Japanese Canadian
                    narrative but rather the creation of a nuanced story of
                        survival<note>Ironically, this inscribes Japanese Canadian narratives into
                        the Canadian literary landscape, given Margaret Atwood&apos;s famous 1972

                        is described as having a photograph of one Japanese Canadian family
                        relocated after the internment to a beet farm near Lethbridge. The family in
                        the photo, all smiles, is standing around a pile of beets. The caption

                        living in Montreal proudly discusses his successful assimilation in the
                        post-war years, along with the integration of his children. It is a

                    for example. The &quot;truth&quot; in this narrative is that any meta-narrative
                    is not possible. Within the frame story of the fairytale is sansei narrator

                <p xml:id="P64"> The film negotiates itself between several layers of meaning: that
                    which is known, that which has been imagined, and that which cannot be added to
                    the re-membering either because it has been permanently forgotten or because it
                    was never understood or known. Functioning as a polyphonic community
                    autobiography, the film records the unveiling of wartime events to a younger
                    generation through a dialogue with history and with older family members.
                    Onodera&apos;s personal experience allows for new insights, while illustrating
                    the motivations and actions of the older generations as explicable, though not
                    always forgivable. Namely Onodera struggles to understand the lack of issei and
                    nisei resistance against systemic oppression: the pervasive attitude of
                    resignation and acceptance that sustained individual and community silences for
                    several decades, largely between Pearl Harbour (December 7 <hi rend="sup"
                        >th</hi>, 1941) until the redress movement was under way starting in the
                    late 70s until 1988.<note>Given the historical tendency to homogenize &quot;<hi

                        acknowledge, of course, that as with any community there was a heterogeneity

                        politics of silence. Onodera also exposes the difficult reality that what
                        was silenced was also forgotten in some cases. Using the dynamics of the
                        image, Onodera re-represent the space of oblivion: those elements of the
                        fragmentary history that have been permanently erased from the cultural
                        community memory. Thus, Onodera&apos;s narrative proposes that the missing
                        history/stories must be imagined into a new vision (revision) of identity:
                        personal, familial and communal.</ref>
                </p>
                <p xml:id="P65"> This reimagining, however, is a complicated process, a fact Onodera
                    illustrates by emphasizing the complexities of displacement: both the historical
                    displacements of immigration and evacuation, as well as the resulting
                    generational disjunctures. The Japanese title that backdrops the English
                    subtitle says: <quote>&quot;issei, nisei, sansei.&quot;</quote> The specific
                    reference to the generations gives added nuance to the English title, which is
                    read as one displaced view – &quot;the&quot; displaced view – shared by the
                    three generations, in relationship to the mainstream. However, <title

                    Japanese and English titles, reflects the different loci of the three narrators
                    as the embodiment of different generational perspectives, each of whom is
                    displaced from the other two generations. <title rend="italic">The Displaced
                        View</title> explores two kinds of generational divide that lead to an
                    inability of communication: the more straightforward linguistic divide of the
                    issei grandmother and the sansei granddaughter, and the complex lack of
                    understanding between the nisei mother and her <emph rend="italic">sansei</emph>

                    narrators are symbolic of larger generational differences within the Japanese
                    Canadian community that took on political significations during the redress
                    period. At the time of this film&apos;s production in the mid-80s, redress was
                    exacerbating existing generational tensions, further complicating the need for
                    Japanese Canadians to find a common voice to represent their collective wishes;
                    generational divides (among other issues) made a community voice seem nearly
                    impossibile, at certain moments during the redress era.<note>Japanese Canadians
                        were often of drastically different opinions about how and what redress
                        should encompass. For details see <bibl>Miki, Roy. <title rend="italic"

                        >evacuation</emph>, being forced to start their lives over three times:
                    first, when they immigrated, then when they were relocated after Pearl Harbour,
                    and again after they were dispersed across the country after the Second World
                    War. The racism and injustice at the hands of a supposedly democratic government
                    made the issei reticent about voicing any discontent about their historical
                    mistreatment. The issei too were often more proficient in Japanese than English.
                    Fearing stirring up racist sentiments again, in general, they preferred to avoid
                    conflict. As sansei scholar Maryka Omatsu puts it, it was the nisei, more than
                    any other generation, who had to learn <quote>&quot;the lesson of the

                    English and so, during the redress campaign, it became their role to translate
                    language and culture between the issei and sansei generations, just as
                    Onodera&apos;s own mother translated, and thus mediated, between grandmother and
                    granddaughter. Sansei,for the most part, speak little to no Japanese, which
                    makes communication with the issei difficult and sometimes only possible through
                    translation. Roy Miki mourns his loss of language in <title rend="italic">Broken

                    <title rend="italic">The Displaced View</title> well represents the linguistic
                    divide between the generations as different spaces of historical belonging
                    and/or development.The main focus of the film is the sansei granddaughter&apos;s
                    wish to &quot;speak to&quot; her grandmother without the required intervention
                    of her nisei mother. At the outset, there exists a distance between the
                    grandmother and the granddaughter, because they do not share a genealogical
                    continuity: a mother tongue. In this sense, the passage of genealogy is lost.
                    The sansei narrator&apos;s inability to understand and communicate with her
                    grandmother is not narrated but rather experienced by the viewer: the English
                    speech is subtitled, because the Japanese-speaking issei grandmother is the
                    target

                        and the dialogue are not always communicated in both languages. (2) When
                        Onodera talks about picking dandelions with her grandmother the English
                        narration is extensive: <quote>&quot;We used to harvest dandelion greens
                            together. I don’t think Mom approved. She didn’t like them very much.
                            She said they were bitter tasting. We mixed them with <emph

                            the things you did. We played games: Candyland, Go Fish, sometimes even
                            Gin Rummy. Did I need to explain the rules in my pigeon English? Would
                            you have understood me otherwise? I knew how to say hot and cold, count
                            up to ten, and the names of some Japanese foods. I think our
                            communication went beyond that. I knew what you meant by your
                            expression, the tone of your voice, your eyes.&quot;</quote> The
                        subtitles in Japanese communicate something slightly different. Instead of
                            <quote>&quot;I don’t think Mom approved. She didn’t like them very
                            much&quot;</quote> as Onodera says in English, the Japanese subtitles
                        translate as <quote>&quot;She doesn’t like it.&quot;</quote> The Japanese
                        subtitles also leave out certain pieces of information. The following
                        sentence is omitted: <quote>&quot;We mixed them with <emph rend="italic"
                                >Shoyu</emph> and ate them with our <emph rend="italic"

                        in the Japanese subtitles of the following section: <quote>&quot;Candyland,
                            Go Fish, sometimes even Gin Rummy. A few years ago I decided to learn
                            Japanese. I wanted to talk to you properly. I quit after two classes.

                        subtitles make no mention of the Japanese language classes. The Japanese
                        subtitles say something like the following: <quote>&quot;I tried to learn
                            Japanese two or three years ago, because I wanted to talk in Japanese

                <p xml:id="P69">Onodera&apos;s desire to use film as a medium through which to
                    communicate with her grandmother is, however, further complicated by the fact
                    that the subtitles (for which she would have had to rely on a translator) are
                    not always faithful to the English. Most notably, not everything in English is
                    subtitled in Japanese. This is problematic, because the film is meant to be a
                    communication with the grandmother, and certain information is inaccessible to
                    her. There could be several reasons for this: (i) It may be an issue of
                    translation, because the translations do not always appear to be professional,
                    and the director&apos;s Japanese is apparently too minimal to double check the
                    meanings. (ii) Onodera is now mediating what her grandmother hears, instead of
                    leaving that task to her mother. As the family translator and, therefore, the
                    mediator of family culture and history, Onodera&apos;s mother has wielded a
                    specific power. The omissions could be construed as a way to present a specific
                    reality to the grandmother. While the mother has always been the translator and
                    the mediator between her daughter and mother, because she did not teach her
                    children Japanese, it is now the film, and the director&apos;s choices, that
                    mediate what the grandmother hears as listener recipient of her message. </p>

                    either to a failing memory or the inevitability of death. Through the medium of
                    film, Onodera not only communicates with her grandmother and re-establishes a
                    link to her; she also records her grandmother for posterity, and in doing so,
                    preserves the cultural heritage ofthe family: their
                        &quot;<soCalled>Japaneseness</soCalled>.&quot;<note>This is a refrain from
                            <title rend="italic">Obāchan’s Garden</title>. More than a decade after
                            <title rend="italic">The Displaced View</title>, Ohama&apos;s
                        documentary expresses it this way: <quote>&quot;For us [the family], Obāchan
                            has been our Japaneseness, but we have never really understood very much
                            about her or the culture.&quot;</quote></note> Onodera&apos;s desire for
                    her grandmother’s immortality articulates one of the predominant concerns of
                    later Japanese Canadian documentaries released in the 1990s: the fear of
                    invisibility through a complex process of assimilation that begins with a loss
                    of language and a lack of communication between generations, creating cultural
                    gaps and an erasure of history. As the issei age and die, families begin to
                    recognize that the issei are bearers of culture, language and history, and when
                    they die, so do the links to the family&apos;s sense of ethnic identity.
                    Grandmothers, and the symbolic role of the matriarch as a link to cultural
                    heritage, become a trope in Japanese Canadian family documentaries (community
                    autobiographies). </p>

                <p xml:id="P75"> Onodera&apos;s directorial focus is an early cinematic narrative of
                    resistance against the imposition of historical oblivion. By archiving fragments
                    of the past and weaving them with a degree of fictionalized content necessary to
                    establish a cohesive narrative, Onodera provides not only one potential history
                    but she also makes possible the potential, <emph rend="italic">à la
                        Agamben</emph>, for new futures for herself, for her family, for Japanese
                    Canadians, and for a new official version of history. This film illustrates the
                    impacts resulting from the loss of heritage language and works to transform
                    those outcomes. Onodera shows the viewer what it means to be unable to
                    understand the issei, quite literally through the absence of subtitles. </p>

                <p xml:id="P76"> In <title rend="italic">The Displaced View</title>, Onodera&apos;s
                    grandmother has the unusual opportunity to speak for herself in her own words
                    and language, without the medium of translation. The film makes a strong
                    political statement by constructing the narrative from the uncommon perspective
                    of the silent and historically silenced subject. This directorial choice is in
                    stark contrast to the appropriation of Japanese Canadian voices and stories that
                    had been taking place in other earlier television and film productions by the
                    dominant discourse.<note>For example, in the earlier NFB propaganda film, <title
                            rend="italic">-- of Japanese Descent</title> (1945), the
                        &quot;relocation centres&quot; are contextualized by the biased narrator who
                        also imposes sentiments and attitudes on Japanese Canadians who smile for
                        the cameras. Even in Pierre Berton&apos;s sympathetic 1970s television
                        production <title rend="italic">Exodus of the Japanese</title> the comments
                        by Mrs. Tanaka and Harry Nobuoka are framed by the larger politically-biased
                        narrative. The television episode <title>&quot;The History we Lived through:
                            The Exodus of the Japanese&quot;</title> of CBC&apos;s <title
                            rend="italic">The Pierre Burton Show</title> aired in 1970, and the
                        transcription in book form by Janice Patton and Pierre Berton under the
                        title <hi rend="italic">The Exodus of the Japanese</hi> was published in
                        1973. Similarly, in the 1975 NFB documentary <hi rend="italic">Enemy
                            Alien</hi>, Mrs. Horiouchi never speaks for herself but serves instead
                        as visual evidence to add credibility to the perspective presented by the
                        voice-over narrator.</note>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="P77"> In contrast, <ref target="#authority">the three narrators of <title
                            rend="italic">The Displaced View</title> each have an autonomous voice:
                        they are not, as has been the case, merely the objects of anthropological
                        investigations by white Canadian men/filmmakers. Each woman recounts her own
                        story, in her own words and dominant language. Onodera positions her own
                        views in contrast to those held by her mother and grandmother, while still
                        creating a permissive space for the various generations to express their
                        differing perspectives. Onodera questions her grandmother&apos;s and
                        mother&apos;s narration of events and contextualizes their attitudes,
                        questioning whether their views are coping mechanisms: still she allows each
                        her own voice. In recognition of the role that cultural narratives (literary
                        and cinematic) play in identity formation, this film fills in the missing
                        historical information by imagining history in the absences created by issei
                        and nisei silence.</ref>

                <p xml:id="P78"> While the film is an ambitious project on the part of the third
                    generation narrator to communicate directly with her grandmother, circumventing
                    her mother&apos;s translation of their conversation and relationship, the desire
                    to overcome linguistic divides results in a greater understanding of her mother.
                    Onodera opens <title rend="italic">The Displaced View</title> by making the
                    following claims: <quote>&quot;My love and respect for my grandmother lead me to
                        ask the questions. I have begun to understand my mother better through the
                        answers.&quot;</quote> The relationship between Onodera and her mother is
                    especially caustic and fraught with generational cultural misunderstandings.
                    While Onodera&apos;s nisei mother speaks English, she has never used that
                    language to defend herself publicly or to resist oppression. The grandmother did
                    not have the language to access power, so her inaction is somehow acceptable to
                    Onodera. On the other hand, Onodera cannot reconcile herself to having a mother
                    who is simply unwilling to fight for her rights: <quote>&quot;I don’t understand
                        why she didn’t fight back, stand up for her rights. I realize the time and
                        the struggle are different, but that doesn’t allow me to forgive
                        her.&quot;</quote>
                    <ref target="#sexuality">Unable to relate to a non-politically engaged mother,
                        Onodera imagines that she has gained her strength from her grandmother.
                        There is little understanding of her mother&apos;s reticence from the feisty
                        third generation narrator who references her own struggle to assert her
                        lesbian identity as an example of her own resistance, in contrast to her
                        mother&apos;s acceptance of the status quo: <quote>&quot;I refuse to be

                        embroiled in a battle for redress, Onodera cannot abide her mother&apos;s
                        attitude of resignation about the historical or her mother&apos;s lack of
                        interest in fighting for her rights, both during her youth and in the

                        Onodera talks about picking dandelions with her grandmother. The English
                        narration is extensive. She says: <quote type="block">&quot;We used to
                            harvest dandelion greens together. I don&apos;t think Mom approved. She
                            didn&apos;t like them very much. She said they were bitter tasting. We

                            knew how to say hot and cold, count up to ten, and the names of some
                            Japanese foods. I think our communication went beyond that. I knew what
                            you meant by your expression, the tone of your voice, your

                        abbreviated. The following sentence is omitted in the Japanese subtitles:

                            them with our <emph rend="italic">gohan.</emph>&quot;</quote> The

                </p>

                <p xml:id="P80"> Of course, the mother&apos;s actions, or rather her political
                    inaction, are representative of a certain faction of the issei and older nisei
                    populations. Most issei (and some nisei, depending on their age and other
                    circumstances) were uncomfortable with the idea of redress and of reawakening
                    the past: the common mantra was <emph rend="italic">shikata ga nai</emph> (it
                    couldn&apos;t be helped/resignation) and <emph rend="italic">enryo
                    </emph>(restraint). In <title rend="italic">The Displaced View</title>, the
                    mother represents the nisei generation as the generation of rupture. This
                    rupture is the outcome of earlier traumas: immigration, wartime evacuation and
                    post-war resettlement. This second generation is the link between the issei and
                    the sansei. Ironically, the nisei are both responsible (in part) for the
                    linguistic and cultural caesura (in that many chose not to teach their children
                    Japanese in favour of assimilation), but they are also left to translate that
                    same language and culture. The nisei were imbued with both the power to transmit
                    and to filter messages, history and culture. The sansei, on the other hand, were
                    third generation Canadians and they felt confident enough about their rights as
                    citizens to, in many cases, lead the charge of redress.<note>This is a
                        simplification of complex community dynamics but for those unfamiliar with
                        the different generational attitudes toward redress these summative comments
                        provide preliminary insight.</note>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="P81"> Before making the film, Onodera had admired her grandmother,
                    considering her not only the symbolic link to family ethnicity, and community
                    history, but a source of feminine strength. Through making the film and asking
                    difficult questions, some of which remain unanswered, she adjusts her attitude
                    toward her mother as she comes to better understand her personal history and the
                    community history. Onodera slowly realizes that her attitude toward her mother
                    may have been somewhat unjust: <quote>&quot;I have never been angry with you
                        [her grandmother], although part of me is still angry with mom. . . . I
                        suppose that&apos;s why I always thought that I gained my strength through
                        you. On the other hand, maybe I’m more like my mother than I care to
                        admit.&quot;</quote> Maryka Omatsu says that even in the multicultural
                    paradigm the ethnic Other is required to cut their attachments to the other
                    nations of the globe, in order to become Canadian: </p>

                <p xml:id="P82">
                    <quote type="block"> Our parents, the nisei were willing to pay this price, and

                        finally receive equal citizenship rights with whites. […] Growing up as
                        adolescents in British Columbia, the nisei were also ashamed of their

                        perfect hip talk, the nisei were nonetheless told by white adolescent ushers
                        to sit in the Oriental sections of the Vancouver movie theatres. They were
                        cut to the quick by the sharp knives of racism. Today, all bear flesh wounds

                    reacted to the evacuation by becoming hyper-Canadian. Onodera, comparing her own
                    struggles to be understood as a lesbian woman with her mother&apos;s denial of
                    her ethnicity, had always believed herself to be different from her
                        mother.<note>Onodera already established a solid reputation as a filmmaker
                        by the time she began making <title rend="italic">The Displaced

                        back to 1979, when she produced her first film as a high school student.
                        While many of her films explore issues of sexual orientation and identity,
                        none of her earlier films had addressed issues of ethnicity.</note> She
                    asks, <quote>&quot;Why didn’t you fight?&quot;</quote> However, the film&apos;s
                    narrative reveals that through the process of filmmaking, Onodera understands
                    that she has behaved similarly, not with respect to being vocal about her sexual
                    identity, but in terms of her Japanese Canadian identity: <quote>&quot;Like my
                        mother I’ve denied my history for so long, pretending to be
                        white.&quot;</quote> In the film, when faced with the complicated reactions
                    of each generation to the events of the evacuation, such as post-war settlement
                    in the location of the internment camps, Onodera questions choices but wisely
                    avoids providing simplistic answers that recuperate diverse Japanese Canadian
                    experiences into mainstream narratives of economic success and/or assimilation,
                    as had habitually been done by filmmakers to date. Instead, she interrogates the
                    outcome: <quote>&quot;Why haven&apos;t these people left, and why do so many

                        </title>minimizes the severity of internment by mentioning the beauty of the
                        locations and by noting that Mrs. Horiouchi chooses to reside in the
                        location of her internment: a continuous displacement. This narrative
                        construction is used to imply that since she has claimed the space of
                        displacement as her own, the internment was somehow less traumatic. However,
                        to be displaced twice, first from the coast, second from the camps, and to
                        then return to the location of the second displacement does not signify that
                        one has come to terms with the original displacement. To live voluntarily in
                        a camp and to be interned are potentially synonymous, if Mrs. Horiouchi is
                        the prisoner of her own history, living out her life in the place of
                        trauma.</note>
                    <title rend="italic">The Displaced View</title>, unlike other narratives of the
                    dominant discourse, does not assimilate the easily acceptable views of Japanese
                    Canadian issei and nisei that absolve the historical government and contemporary
                    society from the transgressions of justice that went on during the Second World
                    War. Thus, film – a medium that she had previously used to defend her sexuality
                    – allows her to explore, preserve and &quot;stand up for&quot; her ethnicity.
                    She says: <quote>&quot;Because I had to fight for my sexuality, I ended up

                <p xml:id="P84"> As the film comes to an end, Onodera closes the frame stories used
                    in the narrative but identifies the search for the family history, the recovery
                    of oblivion, as a work in progress. Likewise, she identifies the notion of
                    multiculturalism as a work in progress. The eye of the Daruma doll is painted in
                    the final scene, symbolizing that Onodera&apos;s dream to communicate with her
                    grandmother has come true. Furthermore, she has created a family myth through
                    which her grandmother will live on. However, that mythopoeia is dynamic, subject
                    to change and metamorphosis, and it encompasses not only the wartime situation
                    but also the narration of the issei&apos;s arrival in <placeName><country
                            subtype="Canada">Canada</country></placeName>.<note>The grandmother in
                        the story arrived as a picture bride, and the grandfather decided to settle
                        in Canada because he wanted to live in a Christian country. Those aspects of
                        a nuanced heterogeneous Japanese Canadian narrative are as important as the
                        narration of wartime injustices.</note> Stagnation in the historical moment
                    of evacuation, on the other hand, does not allow the Japanese Canadian narrative
                    and identity to be fluid: it fossilizes in history. Onodera demonstrates how a
                    lack of generational communication renders the grandmother a representative of
                    family ethnicity, thus rendering ethnicity historical instead of being a
                    comprehensive part of a lived reality, enriched by cultural diversity. The
                    grandmother, rather than fulfilling her role as powerful matriarch endowed with
                    the responsibility of passing on language and tradition to her family is frozen
                    in the time: historical. <ref target="#textual_agency">This has been the
                        tendency of multicultural narratives: to freeze Japanese Canadian identity

                        does not encompass all the various policies and civil/human rights abuses
                        enacted against the Japanese Canadian wartime community), declaring it an

                            not fully acknowledge the pervasive racism that is the root of
                            historical injustice: racism that, in different forms, still

                    <ref target="#race_and_ethnicity">To historicize ethnicity at the moment of
                        victimization is to recuperate it into status quo narratives of enemy alien
                        and Other. Furthermore, the mainstream narratives that evaluate Japanese
                        Canadians according to a protestant work ethic that values economic
                        productivity, in general, claim that Japanese Canadians have recovered from
                        the wartime injustices and the ramifications of those events, based on their
                        economic successes after the war and their continued economic productivity.
                        These narratives of the model minority fail to capture the complex
                        consequences of evacuation during the war and in the ensuing
                            decades.<note>Some of the meta-narratives of the evacuation were created
                            in the post-redress era by Japanese Canadians who were funded by redress
                            money, when writers and directors were willingly and/or unknowingly
                            recuperated by state multicultural constructions, and consequently
                            failed to address the political results of such processes through their
                            own family biographies.</note> Therefore, the narration of discovering
                        the family history to better understand how individuals, families and
                        communities dealt with injustices becomes another important phase in the
                        process of creating dynamic Japanese Canadian narratives that can encompass
                        a plurality of possible histories and futures.</ref> Not all stories are
                    created equal, however, and there are some Japanese Canadian authored
                    meta-narratives of the evacuation that were willingly and/or unknowingly
                    recuperated by state multicultural constructions, and consequently failed to

                    <title rend="italic">The Displaced View</title>, as one of the early texts in
                    the tradition of narrating family histories as part of a larger contribution to
                    community autobiography, falls into the same category as such texts as its
                    predecessor <title rend="italic">Obasan </title>(1981) and the later film <title
                        rend="italic">Obāchan’s Garden</title> (2001). All these texts share the
                    common narrative practice of uncovering and the discovering family histories,
                    for which the events of evacuation are part of larger complex narratives. This
                    is in contrast to many narratives from the dominant discourse that focus solely
                    on the historical narration of evacuation, thereby containing Japanese Canadian
                    history in ways that do not allow for continually developing Japanese Canadian
                    histories and identities. </p>

                <p xml:id="P87"> To finally understand her mother and grandmother, Onodera navigated
                    back from the vocality of the redress campaign to the silence that had marked
                    Japanese Canadian post-war history. The move from secrecy and silence, <emph
                        rend="italic">shikata ga nai</emph> (it couldn&apos;t be helped/resignation)
                    and <emph rend="italic">enryo </emph>(restraint), to personal acknowledgement,
                    political action and public acknowledgement was difficult. Onodera&apos;s film,
                    as an answer to this dynamic, emphasizes the necessity for intergenerational
                    complicity that starts with the sansei narrator&apos;s deepened understanding
                    (if not forgiveness) for her mother&apos;s choices and world views. One
                    potential path toward understanding is a shared family story. This potential
                    future comes, in part, from Onodera&apos;s own self-criticism in regards to her
                    own relationship to her Japanese Canadian identity. The film reveals that
                    Onodera had spent a lifetime denying her ethnicity. Onodera acknowledges that
                    she and her mother have reacted quite similarly to their ethnic identities,
                    which invokes an implicit criticism of contemporary Canadian society. Despite
                    the fact that, as Onodera says, <quote>&quot;the time and the struggle are
                        different, multiculturalism has not erased prejudice or entirely transformed
                        the situation of Japanese Canadians or Canadians of colour, in general,
                        despite a public mandate for multiculturalism promoted by the Multicultural
                        policy (1971) and Act (1988)&quot;.</quote> Given that the Multiculturalism
                    Act was passed in the same year as the film&apos;s release, Onodera&apos;s
                    narrative can be read as a message for what more needs to be accomplished.
                        <title rend="italic">The Displaced View</title> as an open-ended story
                    allows for the possibility of transformation and for individual and community
                    narratives to again be reinvented. This is represented through the more complex
                    understanding established between mother and daughter that suggests the
                    possibility for unresolved relationships to reconfigure. Onodera is more like
                    her mother than she realized and now, rather than both denying their history,
                    there exists the potential for a dialogue. It is only through the constant
                    reworking and intervention into history and the silent spaces that are procured
                    by dominant discourses that one is able to, perhaps, reconstitute one&apos;s own
                    vision of the past. </p>

                <p xml:id="P89"> Such a volatile movement as the sixties and early seventies tends
                    to get straightened in the telling, so that as it recedes from active memory, it
                    becomes more and more difficult to see the initial generative tangle. Such
                    straightened history makes it easier now to feel that we are somehow more
                    theoretically or politically sophisticated, that we have righted the mistakes,
                    or at least can see the naïveté and down-right silliness of midcentury feminism.
                    But to try to see the tangle, to resist the desire to straighten all the
                    threads, can operate as a humbling tonic to temper what might otherwise be
                    historical arrogance.<note><bibl xml:id="kath_ubv_wi"><author>Kathryn Thoms

                <p xml:id="P90"> Kathryn Thoms Flannery&apos;s metaphor, which describes periods of
                    volatile cultural change as tangled and generative skeins of yarn that get
                    unravelled or straightened by the passage of time, implies that historical
                    accounts inevitably simplify. This may be due to the imperatives and constraints
                    of narrative historicism that (as Hayden White has pointed out) are shaped by
                    recognizable tropes and plots. It may also be due to the inevitable loss of
                    information and documents, especially ephemera, that might complicate the
                    record.</p>

                <p xml:id="P91"> However, while Flannery points to the ways in which temporal
                    distance tends to create simplified narratives of past events, it is also—and
                    paradoxically—the case that we can be too close to a set of historical events or
                    debates to see them in their full complexity. As Sheila Rowbotham noted in her
                    very early attempt to outline the history of the women&apos;s liberation
                    movement in Britain, <quote>&quot;It is almost impossible to write about the
                        very recent past.&quot;</quote><note><bibl xml:id="she_ubv_wi"

                    the meaning of events or the identification of key participants are a factor,
                    especially when participants are still alive to contest such histories, as
                    Rowbotham&apos;s apology to her readers indicates: <quote>&quot;If I have
                        distorted anybody&apos;s experience, I apologize in
                            advance.&quot;</quote><note><ref target="#she_ubv_wi">Ibid.,
                        91.</ref></note> Additionally, as is often the case with progressive social
                    movements like the women&apos;s movement, practices of self-critique, including
                    those established by the preceding generation, frequently shape and inform the
                    earliest histories of those movements. The need for subsequent generations of
                    activists and progressive intellectuals to define themselves and their projects
                    differently and anew is a related factor. Feelings inevitably run high. This is
                    not to discount the very real significance of new knowledges and analytical or
                    theoretical paradigms, or of changing socio-cultural conditions. But it does
                    suggest that the representation of relatively recent historical events and
                    situations is complicated by their very recentness. In other words, it is a
                    problem of temporality.</p>

                <p xml:id="P92"> The question or problematic of temporality—a problematic that is
                    implicit in the much debated image of &quot;waves&quot; of feminism—has
                    attracted the attention of feminist critics and theorists over the last decade,
                    prompting a 2002 special issue of <title rend="italic">Tulsa Studies in
                        Women&apos;s Literature</title> on <title>&quot;Feminism and
                        Time&quot;</title> and a 2004 special issue of <title rend="italic">mlq :
                        Modern Language Quarterly</title> on <title>&quot;Feminism in
                        Time.&quot;</title> A 2006 issue of <title rend="italic">pmla</title>
                    similarly devoted a &quot;Theories and Methodologies&quot; section to the topic
                    of &quot;Feminist Criticism Today.&quot; Its dedication <quote>&quot;in memory
                        of Nellie Y. McKay&quot;</quote> points to one of the factors underlying
                    feminism&apos;s current time consciousness: the recent deaths of so many
                    significant second-wave feminists.<note>Audre Lorde, 1934–1992; Grace Fulcher
                        Hartman, 1918–1993; Laura Sabia, 1916–1996; Florence Bird, 1908–1998;
                        Carolyn Heilbrun, 1926–2003; Gloria Anzaldúa, 1942–2004; Andrea Dworkin,
                        1946–2005; Betty Friedan, 1921–2006; Lillian Robinson, 1941–2006; Doris
                        Anderson, 1921–2007.</note> Other factors include the consolidation of the
                    third (or even fourth) wave of the feminist movement, questions about the status
                    of &quot;theory&quot; (which, as Toril Moi points out, usually means
                        <quote>&quot;work done in the poststructuralist tradition&quot;</quote>
                    [1735]), and, finally, what we might call the rise of a millennial consciousness
                    influenced by the dawning of a new millennium which was followed so closely by
                    the events of September 11, 2001.</p>

                <p xml:id="P93"> Another key factor that emerges strongly in many of the recent
                    articles on feminism and temporality is a broad anxiety, or a resigned
                    acknowledgement, that feminism and feminist theory are no longer at the cutting
                    edge, either politically or intellectually. Toril Moi makes this point bluntly
                    in her 2006 <title rend="italic">pmla</title> article, <title>&quot;&apos;I Am
                        Not a Feminist, But…&apos;: How Feminism Became the F-Word&quot;</title>:
                        <quote>&quot;The poststructuralist paradigm is now exhausted….The
                        fundamental assumptions of feminist theory in its various current guises…are
                        still informed by some version of poststructuralism. No wonder, then, that
                        so much feminist work today produces only tediously predictable lines of
                        argument.&quot;</quote><note><bibl xml:id="tor_ubv_wi">

                        <quote>&quot;the difficult, at times painful, recognition that feminism,
                        oddly enough, is not identical to our investments in

                    surface a theme running throughout many of these essays. Almost any engagement
                    with the question of feminism and the temporal raises very real and often very
                    personal anxieties about what is signified by that word. As Margaret Ferguson
                    implies in her introduction to the <title rend="italic">mlq</title> special
                    issue, hope and faith in a different and better future define the deeply felt
                    nature of feminist engagement. They are also, of course, sources of
                    vulnerability.</p>

                <p xml:id="P95">
                    <ref target="#theme_or_motif">All of these issues—the valence of theory, the
                        nature of the feminist project, the imbrication of personal and political
                        identities, the necessity and risk of hoping, the inevitable emotional
                        investments in particular historical narratives—are at play in any project
                        of feminist recovery, especially when the events or documents being
                        recovered are relatively recent. This chapter takes as its point of
                        departure two such projects: a graduate seminar on second-wave feminist
                        texts (especially writing by radical feminists), and doctoral research on
                        English Canadian second-wave feminist periodicals. As we discuss below, both
                        projects throw into relief the degree to which questions of
                        &quot;theory&quot; continue to frame the reception and historicization of
                        recent feminist pasts. While we will allude only tangentially to our
                        classroom experience and to the case of Canadian feminist periodicals, our
                        discussion grows out of these very material engagements. In what follows, we
                        focus on issues related to polemical and theoretical writing to argue for a
                        feminist historicism capable of attending to the generative tangle of
                        feminist engagements in time. Such a historicism, we contend, permits a
                        better understanding of the &quot;all at onceness&quot; of discursive
                        formation during a vital period of political and intellectual foment and

                        questions histories of first-wave American feminism that characterize this
                        movement solely as a suffrage movement. Instead, Firestone identifies the
                        suffrage movement as only one branch of the larger nineteenth-and early
                        twentieth-century Women&apos;s Rights Movement in the United States.
                        Firestone&apos;s article re-evaluates histories that characterize the first
                        wave as a &quot;cop-out&quot; or &quot;reformist&quot; and emphasizes
                            <quote>&quot;a strong radical strain which has been purposely ignored
                            and buried.&quot;</quote> In doing so, she constructs a lineage of
                        radical feminism that her contemporaries can draw on, rather than simply
                        dismissing first-wave feminists as politically naive. While Firestone
                        believes that, ultimately, the &quot;monster of the vote had swallowed
                        everything else&quot; for first-wave feminists, she does not allow this
                        belief to blind her to the more radical strains of early American feminism.
                        Instead, Firestone uses her historical analysis to argue against the
                        single-issue organizing associated with liberal feminism in favour of
                        developing a broader (radical) feminist consciousness capable of combating
                        not only &quot;male chauvinism&quot; but also capitalism and racism among

                        to organize separately from men in the mid-to late 1960s, feminism has been
                        criticized for its privileging of a sisterhood that claimed to include all
                        women but largely reflected the world view of white, middle-class,

                    exchange demonstrates that the unity/diversity debate was present from the

                <p xml:id="P102"> These moments in <title rend="italic">The Other Woman</title>
                    illustrate how one periodical both issued and defended itself against early
                    second-wave critiques of the women&apos;s movement. Even within a single
                    publication, there appears to be no consensus on how the movement should deal
                    with issues of race, class, and sexuality. One moment an editor is concerned
                    with the absence of class and racial diversity; the next moment the privileging
                    of race and class in feminist analysis is critiqued for excluding sexuality. It
                    is this complex relationship between practices of self-critique and feminist
                    analysis that is forgotten when critiques of liberal, middle-class feminism
                    dominate our understanding of the mid-twentieth-century movement.</p>

                <p xml:id="P103"><ref target="#canon_formation">One reason why the complex tangle of
                        early second-wave debate has been flattened out or forgotten, especially
                        among younger feminists, is that the language in which that debate took
                        place is now unfamiliar. It is difficult for students in the
                        twenty-first-century classroom to read the manifestos and critical analyses
                        of early second-wave feminism as anything but theoretically naive. This is
                        due to a number of factors. On the one hand, the genre of the political
                        manifesto, with its list of demands, has largely fallen out of fashion, as
                        have many other forms of polemical writing. It can be challenging for
                        students to imagine articulating a demand, which strikes them as blunt and
                        simplistic, as opposed to fashioning a critique.<note>Admittedly, this is
                            not a new problem. In 1972 Sheila Rowbotham observed that

                                end, even though there is no simple blueprint for translating the
                                everyday possibility within capitalism into the future possibility
                                of socialism. In women&apos;s liberation it is different because we
                                are together in our discontent but not in our notion of what we are

                    &quot;theory&quot; meant something different in the 1970s, especially in the
                    context of British socialism and Marxism, than it means now. Theory, Wiegman
                    says, <quote>&quot;has been institutionalized&quot;</quote> and, we would add,
                    institutionalized to such a degree that it is difficult for students to recover
                    or comprehend a political and intellectual universe of theory-in-the-making, of
                    theory as a process as opposed to theory as an institutional product.</p>

                <p xml:id="P105"> However, while second-wave feminist texts are frequently dismissed
                    by researchers and students because of their perceived lack of theoretical
                    sophistication or lack of commitment to feminist difference, a contrary and
                    nostalgic view of this moment in feminist history has also emerged. In

                    feminist historicism capable of offering a solution to several problems we have

                    the new and the valuable, especially in the context of an academic climate
                    (frequently, if simplistically, characterized as corporate) committed to the
                    manufacture of the new as a self-evident value? How can we capture the
                    complexity, the tangled skein, of feminist history without losing sight of the
                    ineluctable feminist acknowledgement that history is inevitably and necessarily
                    political? And, finally, what can such a history of mid-twentieth-century
                    feminism tell us, not only about feminism but about the larger intellectual
                    history of that period?</p>

                <p xml:id="P109">One possible response to these questions is that alternate modes of
                    historicizing require different metaphors—but not a simple swapping out of the

                    generational and wave metaphors, which have been so thoroughly critiqued for
                    their linear logic and yet retain some emotional if not explanatory force, we
                    need to supplement them in ways that permit other pictures to emerge. As George

                        cutting edge of feminist theory. In fact, the three scholars from whom we
                        borrow these metaphors all contribute to and/or rely on some version of the
                        poststructuralist theory that Moi emphatically asserts is <quote>&quot;now

                    While she is primarily concerned with connections between science and
                    literature, the metaphor she uses to describe this interrelationship can easily
                    be applied to other objects of inquiry. The metaphor of the feedback loop is one
                    of the ways Hayles has unsettled assertions of direct influence throughout her
                    writing. Rather than arguing that science influences literature or vice versa,
                    in her introduction to <title rend="italic">Chaos and Order: Complex Dynamics in
                        Literature and Science</title> Hayles asserts that both literature and
                    science <quote>&quot;are involved in feedback loops with the culture. They help
                        to create the context that energizes the questions they ask; at the same
                        time, they also ask questions energized by the
                            context.&quot;</quote><note><ref target="#hay_ubv_wi">Ibid.,
                        7.</ref></note> The same can be said of feminism. It exists in a feedback
                    loop with the culture of which it is a part. This assertion may seem passé in
                    light of its affinities with the supposedly &quot;exhausted&quot;
                    poststructuralist paradigm, or it may be taken for granted within cultural
                    studies, which has always recognized this interrelationship. However, while the
                    logic of the feedback loop may not be new, it could have significant
                    consequences for a feminist historicism interested in what we earlier referred
                    to as the &quot;all-at-onceness&quot; of discursive formations.</p>

                <p xml:id="P113">In other words, like Foucault&apos;s archaeology, the feedback loop
                    is a model that precludes easy cause-and-effect models of historical analysis.
                    It has the potential to work well as an enabling metaphor in the classroom,
                    where it can sometimes be difficult to convey the complexity of a discursive
                    moment without resorting to a logic of influence. One of the real difficulties
                    in teaching the history of any alternative or progressive social movement is
                    first isolating and then explaining, by contextualizing, the inevitable silent
                    assumptions that underlie or surround public debate. Such assumptions frequently
                    lodge themselves in a word or phrase that is ubiquitous in texts of the period
                    but rarely defined. In the case of mid-<lb/>twentieth-century social movements,
                    including feminism, <emph rend="italic">consciousness</emph> is such a word. We
                    have already alluded to consciousness-raising groups of the late 1960s and early
                    1970s, where the word <hi rend="italic">consciousness</hi> derived from notions
                    of false consciousness then current in both the &quot;old&quot; and
                    &quot;new&quot; left.<note>The first use of the term <emph rend="italic"
                            >consciousness-raising</emph> as a method of feminist sharing, analysis,
                        and theory-making is usually attributed to Kathie Sarachild and Anne Forer
                        (see Brownmiller, <title rend="italic">In Our Time</title>, 21).</note>
                    However, <emph rend="italic">consciousness</emph> also had attached to it
                    reverberations from other cultural sectors, including those of alternative
                    psychiatry (like that of R.D. Laing), new or revived Western counter-cultural
                    interest in Buddhism and other &quot;Eastern&quot; religions, and interest in
                    the use of psychoactive drugs or hallucinogens to produce altered &quot;states
                    of consciousness.&quot; Far from being a theoretically impoverished term, as it
                    may appear to twenty-first-century readers, the term is massively overdetermined
                    in ways that can only be recovered through a thick or tangled appreciation of
                    the historical moment.</p>

                <p xml:id="P114"> The kind of strenuous attention to this historical moment that the
                    feedback loop and archaeology metaphors require enables a better understanding
                    not only of the development of mid-twentieth-century feminism, but of the
                    development of <emph rend="italic">theory</emph> as we have come to understand
                    that term. As we have suggested above, second-wave feminist texts are often
                    dismissed because of their perceived lack of theoretical sophistication.
                    However, careful reconstruction of the ways in which midcentury feminist thought
                    developed coterminously—or in a feedback loop—with other progressive discursive
                    formations suggests another narrative, one that a brief examination of feminist
                    uses of the term <emph rend="italic">consciousness</emph> helps to highlight.
                    Here we will focus on Sheila Rowbotham&apos;s use of that term in her 1972
                    essay, <title>&quot;Problems of Organisation and Strategy.&quot;</title></p>

                <p xml:id="P115">
                    <ref target="politics">The essay describes the need for what Rowbotham calls
                            <quote>&quot;new areas of political resistance&quot;</quote> growing out

                        characteristic of early second-wave feminist organizing. These insights or
                        knowledges, which would eventually be captured and somewhat reduced by the
                        catch phrase &quot;the personal is political,&quot; were born from the close
                        examination and sharing of personal experience. This practice brought new
                        areas into the realm of the political, areas like family relations,
                        &quot;sexual culture,&quot; and &quot;female self-image.&quot;<note><bibl

                        male-dominated left—in favour of <quote>&quot;an idea of consciousness which
                            is not the transmission of some already established higher body of
                            knowledge but of learning by discovering yourself in relation to

                        Instead, in the feminist small group &quot;you are brought to see yourself

                        What is learned in this process is the degree to which the capitalist and
                        patriarchal &quot;onslaught on our consciousness is all-pervasive and
                        profoundly internalised&quot;<note><ref target="#row2_ubv_wi">Ibid.,

                </p>

                <p xml:id="P116"> It will be obvious from the brief passages we have quoted that
                    Rowbotham uses the term <emph rend="italic">consciousness</emph> to evoke a very
                    wide range of intellectual, political, psychological, and psychic processes and
                    states. Today we would certainly recognize one of these as the process that
                    Althusser describes as interpellation through ideological state apparatuses,
                    especially systems of education, a process he outlines in <title>&quot;Ideology
                        and Ideological State Apparatuses.&quot;</title> This essay was published in
                    English translation in 1971, one year before Rowbotham wrote her essay on
                        <title>&quot;Problems of Organisation and Strategy.&quot;</title>
                    Althusser&apos;s earlier work was already well known to British leftists, not
                    least through his publications and interviews in the <title rend="italic">New
                        Left Review</title>. Indeed, Rowbotham appears to consciously borrow from
                    his 1970 interview, <title>&quot;Philosophy as a Political Weapon,&quot;</title>
                    in the conclusion to her article when she argues for the making of a ground-up
                    theory of socialist feminism: <quote>&quot;The making of such a theory is an
                        essential weapon….&quot;</quote><note><ref target="#row2_ubv_wi">Ibid.,
                            75.</ref></note> It would be easy here to make the cause-and-effect
                    argument for influence: that an emerging feminist theory was influenced and
                    shaped by the work of poststructuralist philosophers like Althusser. However,
                    this ignores the degree to which significant feminist theoretical documents were
                    circulating alongside those that would become major contributions to
                    poststructuralism. Juliet Mitchell&apos;s landmark essay, <title>&quot;Women:
                        The Longest Revolution,&quot;</title> appeared in the <title rend="italic"
                        >New Left Review</title> in 1966. In it she concluded, <quote>&quot;The
                        whole pyramid of discrimination [against women] rests on a solid
                        extra-economic foundation—education.&quot;</quote> Again we want to resist a
                    cause-and-effect argument that would suggest that Althusser was influenced by
                    early second-wave feminist work. Instead, we are arguing for a feminist
                    historicism that is attentive to the &quot;all-at-onceness&quot; of periods of
                    volatile intellectual, cultural, and political change: a historicism that can
                    account for small-group or consciousness-raising work as a process of
                    theory-in-the-making, and that locates feminist thought at the <emph
                        rend="italic">centre</emph> of intellectual formation in such periods, not
                    the periphery of oft-cited theoretical texts such as <title>&quot;Ideology and
                        Ideological State Apparatuses.&quot;</title></p>

                <p xml:id="P117"> However, in advocating a historicism that makes connections within
                    rather than across time, we are not suggesting that development across time is
                    unimportant or uninteresting. Admittedly, the usefulness of disrupting the
                    continuity of time and the logic of development is limited by what Felski refers
                    to as feminism&apos;s <quote>&quot;orientation to the
                            future.&quot;</quote><note><ref target="#fel_ubv_wi">Felski,

                    is inevitable, but we cannot forgo the possibility of change that improves
                    conditions for women. Felski explains, <quote>&quot;Feminists often think of
                        themselves as allies of the new, as fervent proponents of radical
                        change&quot;</quote><note><ref target="#fel_ubv_wi">Ibid., 21.</ref></note>
                    in their commitment to a better future for women. Consequently, feminist
                    historians cannot completely do away with progress, <quote>&quot;but we can
                        think of belief in progress as a wager with the future, as a nascent hope,
                        rather than a complacent certainty, that something better is around the
                        corner.&quot;</quote><note><ref target="#fel_ubv_wi">Ibid.,

                    préconise l&apos;éloge consensuel de l&apos;altérité, ou le ludisme se veut

                        tout en restant à l&apos;écoute de l&apos;autre. Car l&apos;autre est celle
                        ou celui ou simplement ce qui rappelle la locutrice à son être à soi. Cette

                <p xml:id="P243">En revanche, l&apos;on peut se demander si la négation se veut

                    de contacts que traverse la narratrice française toujours traumatisée par son
                    enfance algérienne, &quot;jalouse de ne pas être une vieille souche&quot; (40),
                    méprisante de cette appellation transnationale de &quot;<emph rend="italic"

                    elle l&apos;englobe tout à la fois. Si le texte de <persName>Balzano</persName>

                    transculture et ses rapports aux savoirs féministes et postcoloniaux; le rire
                    romanesque et son rapport incertain à la subversion sociale. Ce qui rassemble
                    ces trois volets, ce qui les renvoie au féminisme littéraire les ayant précédés,
                    est la problématique persistante du sujet féminin, que celui-ci soit lyrique,
                    postcolonial ou ludique, et ses savoirs-de-vivre dans le monde déployés dans les
